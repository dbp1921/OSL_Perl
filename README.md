Abstract: 
In this perl project, we have implemented address book using Perl's OOP capabilities. This provides facilities including searching, sorting, format printing, array manipulation, and I/O.

Project Flow Diagram: 
1)Basic structure
We provide the user with the options to add a new entry, delete an existing entry, sorting the records in either ascending or descending order and search the data based on any of the details such as first name, last name, street, city, country, date of birth,etc. If the user does not enter the data in the desired format then it prompts the user to enter that detail until it meets the proper format. The user is asked to enter the first name, last name, home contact, mobile number, home address, date of birth and email address.

2)Regular expressions.
The syntax of regular expressions in Perl is very similar to what you will find within other regular expression.supporting programs, such as sed, grep, and awk. The basic method for applying a regular expression is to use the pattern binding operators =~ and !~. The first operator is a test and assignment operator.

3)Object Oriented Programming Logic
Perl provides the OOP features of data encapsulation and inheritance using modules and packages. A class in Perl is simply a package. A package for a class provides all the methods for objects created for the class.
	
  
Functions/Features of Perl used:
In  this  game,  we  have  used  some of the features of python which are  listed​ ​below:  
Basic Perl Programming Constructs
Data Types
Scalars
Arrays
Loops
Date and Time
File I/O
Regular Expressions
Object Oriented Programming Concepts

Limitations: 
This perl project has the following limitations:
The GUI can be improved.
We could add more functionalities in this address book project.
We can also include an automatic city and country entry based on the street location.


Conclusion:  
In this  perl project,  we  cleared  the  basic  concept  of  perl.  We  learnt  various  syntaxes  of  perl,  using  data types,  arrays,  object oriented concepts and implementing file I/O based on user input.
